It doesn't have inputs to receive commands.
Nor does it follow other twins to synthesise any data.

== When to use it

* Use it when the underlying asset needs exclusively to broadcast data - i.e. not receive any data. (Use a xref:{relfileprefix}synthesiser_twin{relfilesuffix}[Synthesiser Twin] for this purpose)
* Any data source emitting data asynchronously can be modelled as a publisher.
