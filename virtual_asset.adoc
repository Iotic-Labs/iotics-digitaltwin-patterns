# Description
The Virtual Asset pattern involves the virtualisation of a real-world entity or asset, where disparate pieces of information related to the asset are scattered across different systems. The pattern establishes a centralised virtual representation of the asset, acting as an aggregation point that offers a unified view, or "single pane of glass," to the underlying asset. This virtual representation is a crucial abstraction layer that facilitates streamlined access to the distributed data associated with the real-world asset.

# Problem Statement
In complex systems, real-world assets often have their data spread across various systems, making it challenging to identify the locations of these data fragments, track changes, discover available data, and interpret it consistently due to a lack of inherent semantics. This dispersion hinders the efficient utilization of the asset's information and creates difficulties in maintaining a holistic view.

# Solution Overview
The solution involves the virtualisation of the real-world asset by aggregating its metadata and providing access to the underlying data through a centralised point. Metadata aggregation serves as a bridge between the physical asset and its distributed data, offering a normalized and unified perspective. Semantically describing the metadata is a crucial aspect of this pattern, providing a mechanism for consumers to autonomously understand the data. This semantic layer adds clarity and context, enabling more effective interpretation and utilization of the asset's information.

# Application in the Real World
Consider a smart city infrastructure where data about various components, such as traffic signals, surveillance cameras, and environmental sensors, is dispersed across multiple systems. The Virtualised Asset pattern can be applied to create a centralised virtual representation of the city's infrastructure. This virtualised entity acts as a single interface, allowing stakeholders to access and understand the data related to each asset seamlessly.
