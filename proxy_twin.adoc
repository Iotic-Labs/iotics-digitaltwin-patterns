= Proxy Twin

A proxy twin is a twin that has feeds publishing data.
It doesn't have inputs to receive commands.
It follows at least one other twin but instead of synthesising the data, 
it simply republishes the same data feed.

== When to use it

* Use it when you want to aggregate data feeds & republish them, as is, on a single twin. This could be for:
** ease of management - a single public (to the Iotics network) twin, aggregating private twin feeds;
** content grouping for discoverability - related feeds in one place.
