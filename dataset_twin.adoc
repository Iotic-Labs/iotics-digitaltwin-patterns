It typically represents a dataset whose properties are represented as metadata.

A dataset twin can, most likely, be modelled with the https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/[DCAT Ontology], an RDF vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogs published on the Web.

The dataset twin closely matches the concept of https://nanopub.org/wordpress/[Nanopublication].

A dataset twin may be extended with feeds to publish events representing changes to the dataset.
