= Data marketplace

A data marketplace is an online place where data can be found and accessed under predefined conditions: data can be bought/sold, exchanged under predefined governance rules etc.
Access to the data marketplace can also be controlled.

With IOTICS a data marketplace is also an asset data marketplace.

In IOTICS a data marketplace is implemented by deploying hosts in a marketplace network.
