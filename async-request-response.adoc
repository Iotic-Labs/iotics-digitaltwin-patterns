= Async request-response

WORK IN PROGRESS

IOTICS Twins' inputs can be used to model any async request/response.

1. A requestor twin specifies a "response input"
1. A responder twin specifies a "request input"; the payload for the request command is specified semantically as a set of key/value/unit triples. The payload must allow for specifying the link to the "response input" and a response reference.
1. The requestor sends the request to the "request input"
1. The responder sends the response to the "response input"

Multiple responses can be sent to the "response input" each with their own sequence number

In case the response has a stream semantic (hence the request command is a subscription), the responder must allow a request command for unsubscribe.
