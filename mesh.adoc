The mesh is the most generic application pattern for IOTICS Digital Twins. 

image::images/mesh.png[Mesh]

Each twin in the mesh is accessible to other twins based on the brokered interactions mechanics provided by IOTICS.

Each agent / application implements its use cases or, when multiple agents/twins cooperate they behave akin to multi-agent systems.
